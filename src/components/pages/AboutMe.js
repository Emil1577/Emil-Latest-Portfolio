      <p>
      Growing up, my fascination with technology was insatiable. I relished the opportunity to disassemble my toys and manipulate their parts, always eager to understand how they worked and the purpose of each component. This curiosity ultimately led me to pursue a degree and career in Electronics and Communications engineering, which I found to be both challenging and enjoyable.

      <p>However, as the internet continued to grow and evolve, my interest in software engineering also piqued. I was always curious about this field, but didn't have the time to explore it while working as an Electrical Engineer. That changed when I decided to take on a new challenge, which led me to complete an extensive 3-month Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp course at UC Berkeley Extension.</p>

      <p>I am highly motivated and excited to start a new chapter in my career as a software engineer and eager to expand my knowledge and experience. </p>
